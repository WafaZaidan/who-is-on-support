# who-is-on-support

On my blog wafa.codes, I wrote a step-by-step tutorial to build a Python script that fetches data from Googlesheets and posts it to Slack in order to notify my team of who's on support each week. I also added steps for how to host it on AWS. 
This repo is to show an example of how the final script should look like so it acts as a guideline for people following my tutorial
Please feel free to raise issues or post a comment on the script if you have any! I will be more than happy to respond and see what you think!
